CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet
It gives a page visuals and all the styling
It is basically the visual features of a webpage
It used together HTML and used to design webpages
It saved with .css extension and linked to a HTML page
CSS is linked to HTML by using a anchor link in the HEAD part of HTML page
<!-- <head>
<a rel="stylesheet" href="location of css" type="text/css">
</head> -->
how to test a CSS file? Simply make any changes like adding some properties or just anything and see if it reflects, if it does not then there's soemthign wrong.
The usual Syntax of CSS is:
<!-- Selector {
    property1: value;
    property1: value;
    property1: value;
} -->
CSS Selectors: VVVVV Important 
HTML and CSS are not exactly linked so you cannot expect changes or styling to takeplace appropriately. 
HEnce we use selectors, they are a way of GRABBING and MANIPULATING HTML
There are differnet ways, different types and each used for differnet reaoson. But they all turn out pretty much the same
1. Element Selector: Selects a element and takes value or styles them
<!-- EG: h1 {
    color: blue;
} -->
2. Class Selector: Lets you select HTML element based on their class attribute.
In order to select using a class element , we need to use a '.'(period) prior to it.
<!-- .class_name {
    property: value;
} --> 
Used for reusuable components
Class selector is the most used
3. ID Selector: Similar to class selector but it allows you to select elements using the ID attribute since a ID is unique acroos the webpage.
It can be enforced using '#'
<!-- #id {
    property: value;
} -->
It is redundant, cannot be used for many components or difficult to use for all components
