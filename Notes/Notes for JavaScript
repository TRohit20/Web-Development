You are often going to set data in a variable in a dynamic fashion.
Variable is a reference label in simple terms

syntax of defining a variable:
<!-- 
1st way: 'var' can be used overall the program as universal
var ref_name = "rohit"
ref_name= 10  

2nd way: 'let' will only be used within the scope where it's declared
let ref_name= "rohit"

3rd way: 'const' can never be modified or changed. If tried, will lead to error
cnost pi=3.14
-->

Defining and assigning the variable is not the same.
Eg:
<!-- var a; //this is just declaration
a=10; //this is the initialisation
var b =2 //this is both declaration and initialisation -->

Console.log allows you to see things in the console
