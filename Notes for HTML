Very Important NOTE: A SINGLE ERROR CAN LEAD TO A CASCADE OF ERRORS

1.head elements cannot have elements like p inside of them
2. There are 3 different types of lists: ordered, unordered, Descriptive
3. two parts to a HTMl: Head(data that cannot be seen except for the title) and Body(Contains data that is visible on the site)
4. Head is the part of the HTMl where CSS files or JS files are linked to the HTMl
5. Body is the part of HTMl that contains data which will be interactive or visible
6. H1 can only be used once in a HTML file
7. Strong, abbr(abbriveations), em(emphasize) are few elements used to emphasize or bold the text between their tags
8. Links can be attached to the html page in multiple ways:
Anchor tag "<a></a>" is used for adding links or images
(i) Absolute Link reference where the link is from outside our project or on the web. link can be copied and linked
(ii) Relative Links are those which are files present in same folder as our project they can be directly linked by typing the name and extension
(iii) A link to different section on the same page. It refers to a section inside the page or internal reference.
We do that using sections tag along with ID attribute for reference.
NOTE: All the links syntax is identical to follow: <a href="link" >text to be clicked upon for accessing link</a>
Sections need to have Headings nested inside of them.
<nav></nav> tags are used to create navigation bar for the use of internal link reference.
anchor tag with # is used as a internal link to point back to the top.

LINK NAMING CONVENTIONS:
Avoid printing full website links, instead use abbriveations like a short name
Avoid "links to" phrase
Keep the link text as shorrt as possible. Topic not sentences
Never use "Click here", rather use topics.

A link to downlaod a file we have can be given by anchor tag along with download attribute
Cannot have download or links inside dl or dd 
Next up: 
ADDING IMAGES TO HTML Files.(Using the img tag)
The syntax is as given below: Img tag does not have a ending tag or it ends with /> which means it is self closing(not required in HTML5).
<img src="" alt"" title="" width="" height="" loading="">  here: src refers to the source of the image and 'alt' is a text reference in case of image not being viewed or loaded.
Attributes are key to adding a image. the above is syntax for relative linking of the image.
Loading attribute should be provided when required or by defaulft it is set to being eager.
Lazy is given as loading attribute in case when the image needs to be loaded only when it needs to be demonstrated.
Using lazy is a good technique when you are using a lot of images on your webpage 
A QUICK TIP:
Instead of typing br multiple times just time br*nooftimes you want it.
Now "Figure" is a new element can be used to wrap around image. SYNTAX:
<!-- <figure> image is inside the figure elemt and we add a caption related to the image. it is directly related to the image inside.
we add the caption using FIGCAPTION element</figure> -->
<figure>img <figcaption> caption realted to the image goes here </figcaption></figure>
A FIGCAPTION can either the first thing or the last thing inside a figure element
